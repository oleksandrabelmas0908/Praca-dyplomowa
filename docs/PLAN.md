# Plan

## Threadpool (TASK-7)

With `DB_DRIVER=sync`, FastAPI runs the plain `def` handlers in AnyIO's threadpool. Its size is
set per Uvicorn worker process by `THREADPOOL_SIZE`, which defaults to **40, AnyIO's own
default**. The E1 baseline keeps 40.

## Redis cache (TASK-8)

### Instance

`redis-cache`, Redis 8.10.2, `maxmemory 64mb`, `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`, no RDB snapshots
and no AOF. It is a separate instance from the future Celery broker, because a cache evicts under
memory pressure and a broker must never do that.

### Why 64 MB

One cached product takes about 1.8 kB in Redis, so 64 MB holds about **32,600 of the 100,000
seeded products, roughly one third**, when it holds nothing else (measured by requesting 50,000
distinct products: 32,620 keys remained, 17,368 evicted). List entries are much larger: 41 kB
for `limit=20` and 197 kB for `limit=100`. They compete for the same 64 MB, so fewer products
fit when lists are cached too.

Under sustained load Redis stays at the limit and evicts rather than growing. After 61,200
requests over 60,000 distinct products plus list pages, memory use was 67.0 MB of 67.1 MB and
50,152 keys had been evicted.

### Key scheme

| Key | Holds | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|
| `product:{id}` | one product, as served by `GET /catalog/products/{id}` | deleted by `PATCH /catalog/products/{id}`, otherwise TTL |
| `product_list:{sha256}` | one list response, as served by `GET /catalog/products` | TTL only |

The list hash covers `category`, `min_price`, `max_price`, `limit` and `offset` as a JSON object
with sorted keys. Unset filters are left out, and prices are normalised so that `100` and `100.00`
give the same key. The order of parameters in the query string therefore does not matter.

The value is the response JSON exactly as served, so a hit returns it without touching Pydantic.

### Expiry and staleness

Every write sets the TTL from `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`. List keys are never invalidated: finding the
lists that contain an updated product would mean tracking list membership, which is not worth it
for a service whose writes are rare and whose experiment is about reads.

The staleness this allows:

- After a product is updated, a cached list can show its old values for up to
  `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`.
- A single product is normally fresh on the next read. Its key can still be stale for up to
  `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` if a read that missed before the update commits writes the old value back
  after the delete. This is the usual cache-aside race.
- `make seed` reloads the products table without touching Redis. Clear `redis-cache` or wait one
  TTL after reseeding.

### Switching the cache off

With `CACHE_ENABLED=false`, no Redis client is created, so there is no connection and no round
trip, and the handlers run the same database path as before the cache existed.
